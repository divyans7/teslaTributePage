			<h3> Some Basic information & Timeline of life of Sir Tesla </h3>
			<li><strong>Jul 10 1856 - Nikola Tesla Is Born</strong> <br> Tesla was born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire near the town of GospiÄ‡, in the territory of modern-day Croatia.
			</li>
			<li><strong>1875 - Tesla Enrolls At Austrian Polytechnic</strong> <br>At the Polytechnic school Tesla began his studies in mechanical and electrical engineering. </li>
			<li><strong>1882 - Nikola Tesla begins working for Continental Edison</strong><br>In 1882 Tesla moved to Paris, to work as an engineer for the Continental Edison Company, designing improvements to electric equipment brought overseas from Edison's ideas.
			</li>
			<li><strong>1882 - Tesla Identifies Magnetic Induction Field Principle</strong><br> In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines.</li>
			<li><strong>Jun 6 1884 - Tesla arrives in the United States</strong><br> On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York City with little besides a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, a former employer. </li>
			<li><strong>1885 - Nikola Tesla quits working for Edison</strong><br> Tesla claims he was offered US$50,000 (~ US$1.1 million in 2007, adjusted for inflation) if he redesigned Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy.</li>
			<li><strong>1886 - Nikola Tesla forms Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company</strong><br> Located in Rahway, New Jersey, the company was formed after Tesla left Thomas Edison's employment, after a contractual disagreement. Tesla planned to sell and license his patent and innovations.</li>
			<li><strong>1887 - War of Currents era begins</strong><br>During the initial years of electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the United States and Edison was not inclined to lose all his patent royalties.Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps that were the principal load of the day, and with motors. Direct current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation.</li>
			<li><strong>Apr 1887 - Nikola Tesla begins experimenting with X-Rays</strong><br>In April 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called X-rays using his own single terminal vacuum tubes (similar to his patent #514,170). This device differed from other early X-ray tubes in that it had no target electrode.</li>
			<li><strong></strong>May 16 1888 - Tesla Delivers Lecture: A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers<br>At an AIEE meeting on May 16, 1888, Nikola Tesla delivered a lecture entitled A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers, describing the equipment which allowed efficient generation and use of polyphase alternating currents.</li>
			<li><strong>1891-Nikola Tesla Patents the Tesla Coil</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>Jul 30 1891 - Nikola Tesla becomes a citizen of the United States</strong><br>On 30 July 1891, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States at the age of 35. </li>
			<li><strong>1893 - Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse power the World's Columbian Exposition</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>1899 - Tesla moves to research facility in Colorado Springs</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>1901 - Construction begins on Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>1913 - Tesla Patents Bladeless Turbine</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>1915 - Tesla and Edison ignored by Nobel Prize committee</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>Aug 4 1915 - Tesla Files Lawsuit Against Guglielmo Marconi</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>Jul 10 1934 - The New York Times publicizes Nikola Tesla's particle Beam research</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>Jan 7 1943 - Nikola Tesla Dies</strong><br></li>
			<li><strong>1960 - 'Tesla' Defined As a Unit of Measure</strong><br></li>
